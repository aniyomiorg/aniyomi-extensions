## Prerequisites

Before you start, please note that the ability to use following technologies is **required** and that existing contributors will not actively teach them to you.

- Basic [Android development](https://developer.android.com/)
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- Web scraping
    - [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
    - [CSS selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors)
    - [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/)
    - [JSoup](https://jsoup.org/)

### Tools

- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- Emulator or phone with developer options enabled and a recent version of Aniyomi installed
- [Icon Generator](https://as280093.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/icons-launcher.html)

### Cloning the repository

Some alternative steps can be followed to ignore "repo" branch and skip unrelated sources, which will make it faster to pull, navigate and build. This will also reduce disk usage and network traffic.

<details><summary>Steps</summary>

1. Make sure to delete "repo" branch in your fork. You may also want to disable Actions in the repo settings.
2. Do a partial clone.
    ```bash
    git clone --filter=blob:none --no-checkout <fork-repo-url>
    cd aniyomi-extensions/
    ```
3. Configure sparse checkout.
    ```bash
    # enable sparse checkout
    git sparse-checkout set
    # edit sparse checkout filter
    vim .git/info/sparse-checkout
    # alternatively, if you have VS Code installed
    code .git/info/sparse-checkout
    ```
    Here's an example:
    ```bash
    /*
    !/src/*
    !/multisrc/overrides/*
    !/multisrc/src/main/java/eu/kanade/tachiyomi/multisrc/*
    # allow a single source
    /src/<lang>/<source>
    # allow a multisrc theme
    /multisrc/src/main/java/eu/kanade/tachiyomi/multisrc/<source>
    /multisrc/overrides/<source>
    # or type the source name directly
    <source>
    ```
4. Configure remotes.
    ```bash
    # add upstream
    git remote add upstream <aniyomi-repo-url>
    # optionally disable push to upstream
    git remote set-url --push upstream no_pushing
    # ignore 'repo' branch of upstream
    # option 1: use negative refspec
    git config --add remote.upstream.fetch "^refs/heads/repo"
    # option 2: fetch master only (ignore all other branches)
    git config remote.upstream.fetch "+refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/upstream/master"
    # update remotes
    git remote update
    # track master of upstream instead of fork
    git branch master -u upstream/master
    # checkout
    git switch master
    ```
5. Useful configurations. (optional)
    ```bash
    # prune obsolete remote branches on fetch
    git config remote.origin.prune true
    # fast-forward only when pulling master branch
    git config pull.ff only
    ```
6. Later, if you change the sparse checkout filter, run `git sparse-checkout reapply`.

## Getting help

- Join [the Discord server](https://discord.gg/F32UjdJZrR) for online help and to ask questions while developing your extension.
- There are some features and tricks that are not explored in this document. Refer to existing extension code for examples.

## Writing an extension

The quickest way to get started is to copy an existing extension's folder structure and renaming it as needed. We also recommend reading through a few existing extensions' code before you start.

### Setting up a new Gradle module

Each extension should reside in `src/<lang>/<mysourcename>`. Use `all` as `<lang>` if your target source supports multiple languages or if it could support multiple sources.

The `<lang>` used in the folder inside `src` should be the major `language` part. For example, if you will be creating a `pt-BR` source, use `<lang>` here as `pt` only. Inside the source class, use the full locale string instead.

#### Extension file structure

The simplest extension structure looks like this:

```console
$ tree src/<lang>/<mysourcename>/
src/<lang>/<mysourcename>/
├── AndroidManifest.xml
├── build.gradle
├── res
│   ├── mipmap-hdpi
│   │   └── ic_launcher.png
│   ├── mipmap-mdpi
│   │   └── ic_launcher.png
│   ├── mipmap-xhdpi
│   │   └── ic_launcher.png
│   ├── mipmap-xxhdpi
│   │   └── ic_launcher.png
│   ├── mipmap-xxxhdpi
│   │   └── ic_launcher.png
│   └── web_hi_res_512.png
└── src
    └── eu
        └── kanade
            └── tachiyomi
                └── animeextension
                    └── <lang>
                        └── <mysourcename>
                            └── <MySourceName>.kt

13 directories, 9 files
```

#### AndroidManifest.xml
A minimal [Android manifest file](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro) is needed for Android to recognize a extension when it's compiled into an APK file. You can also add intent filters inside this file (see [URL intent filter](#url-intent-filter) for more information).

#### build.gradle
Make sure that your new extension's `build.gradle` file follows the following structure:

```gradle
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
apply plugin: 'kotlin-android'

ext {
    extName = '<My source name>'
    pkgNameSuffix = '<lang>.<mysourcename>'
    extClass = '.<MySourceName>'
    extVersionCode = 1
    containsNsfw = true
}

apply from: "$rootDir/common.gradle"
```

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `extName` | The name of the extension. |
| `pkgNameSuffix` | A unique suffix added to `eu.kanade.tachiyomi.animeextension`. The language and the site name should be enough. Remember your extension code implementation must be placed in this package. |
| `extClass` | Points to the class that implements `AnimeSource`. You can use a relative path starting with a dot (the package name is the base path). This is used to find and instantiate the source(s). |
| `extVersionCode` | The extension version code. This must be a positive integer and incremented with any change to the code. |
| `libVersion` | (Optional, defaults to `13`) The version of the [extensions library](https://github.com/jmir1/extensions-lib) used. |
| `containsNsfw` | (Optional, defaults to `false`) Flag to indicate that a source contains NSFW content. |

The extension's version name is generated automatically by concatenating `libVersion` and `extVersionCode`. With the example used above, the version would be `12.1`.

### Core dependencies

#### Extension API

Extensions rely on [extensions-lib](https://github.com/jmir1/extensions-lib), which provides some interfaces and stubs from the [app](https://github.com/jmir1/aniyomi) for compilation purposes. The actual implementations can be found [here](https://github.com/jmir1/aniyomi/tree/master/app/src/main/java/eu/kanade/tachiyomi/animesource). Referencing the actual implementation will help with understanding extensions' call flow.

#### Rate limiting library

[`lib-ratelimit`](https://github.com/jmir1/aniyomi-extensions/tree/master/lib/ratelimit) is a library for adding rate limiting functionality as an [OkHttp interceptor](https://square.github.io/okhttp/interceptors/).

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation project(':lib-ratelimit')
}
```

#### Additional dependencies

You may find yourself needing additional functionality and wanting to add more dependencies to your `build.gradle` file. Since extensions are run within the main Aniyomi app, you can make use of [its dependencies](https://github.com/jmir1/aniyomi/blob/master/app/build.gradle.kts).

For example, an extension that needs coroutines, it could add the following:

```gradle
dependencies {
    compileOnly(libs.bundles.coroutines)
}
```

> Note that several dependencies are already exposed to all extensions via Gradle version catalog.
> To view which are available view `libs.versions.toml` under the `gradle` folder

Notice that we're using `compileOnly` instead of `implementation`, since the app already contains it. You could use `implementation` instead for a new dependency, or you prefer not to rely on whatever the main app has at the expense of app size.

Note that using `compileOnly` restricts you to versions that must be compatible with those used in [Aniyomi v0.10.12+](https://github.com/jmir1/aniyomi/blob/v0.10.12/app/build.gradle.kts) for proper backwards compatibility.

### Extension main class

The class which is referenced and defined by `extClass` in `build.gradle`. This class should implement either `AnimeSourceFactory` or extend one of the `AnimeSource` implementations: `AnimeHttpSource` or `ParsedAnimeHttpSource`.

| Class | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
|`AnimeSourceFactory`| Used to expose multiple `AnimeSource`s. Use this in case of a source that supports multiple languages or mirrors of the same website. For similar websites use [theme sources](#multi-source-themes). |
| `AnimeHttpSource`| For online source, where requests are made using HTTP. |
| `ParsedAnimeHttpSource`| Similar to `AnimeHttpSource`, but has methods useful for scraping pages. |

#### Main class key variables

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `name` | Name displayed in the "Sources" tab in Aniyomi. |
| `baseUrl` | Base URL of the source without any trailing slashes. |
| `lang` | An ISO 639-1 compliant language code (two letters in lower case). |
| `id` | Identifier of your source, automatically set in `AnimeHttpSource`. It should only be manually overriden if you need to copy an existing autogenerated ID. |

### Extension call flow

#### Popular Anime

a.k.a. the Browse source entry point in the app (invoked by tapping on the source name).

- The app calls `fetchPopularAnime` which should return a `AnimesPage` containing the first batch of found `SAnime` entries.
    - This method supports pagination. When user scrolls the manga list and more results must be fetched, the app calls it again with increasing `page` values(starting with `page=1`). This continues until `AnimesPage.hasNextPage` is passed as `true` and `AnimesPage.mangas` is not empty.
- To show the list properly, the app needs `url`, `title` and `thumbnail_url`. You must set them here. The rest of the fields could be filled later.(refer to Anime Details below)
    - You should set `thumbnail_url` if is available, if not, `fetchAnimeDetails` will be **immediately** called.(this will increase network calls heavily and should be avoided)

#### Latest Anime

a.k.a. the Latest source entry point in the app (invoked by tapping on the "Latest" button beside the source name).

- Enabled if `supportsLatest` is `true` for a source
- Similar to popular anime, but should be fetching the latest entries from a source.

#### Anime Search

- When the user searches inside the app, `fetchSearchAnime` will be called and the rest of the flow is similar to what happens with `fetchPopularAnime`.
    - If search functionality is not available, return `Observable.just(AnimesPage(emptyList(), false))`
- `getFilterList` will be called to get all filters and filter types. **TODO: explain more about `Filter`**

##### Filters

The search flow have support to filters that can be added to a `FilterList` inside the `getFilterList` method. When the user changes the filters' state, they will be passed to the `searchRequest`, and they can be iterated to create the request (by getting the `filter.state` value, where the type varies depending on the `Filter` used). You can check the filter types available [here](https://github.com/jmir1/aniyomi/blob/master/app/src/main/java/eu/kanade/tachiyomi/source/model/Filter.kt) and in the table below.

| Filter | State type | Description |
| ------ | ---------- | ----------- |
| `Filter.Header` | None | A simple header. Useful for separating sections in the list or showing any note or warning to the user. |
| `Filter.Separator` | None | A line separator. Useful for visual distinction between sections. |
| `Filter.Select<V>` | `Int` | A select control, similar to HTML's `<select>`. Only one item can be selected, and the state is the index of the selected one. |
| `Filter.Text` | `String` | A text control, similar to HTML's `<input type="text">`. |
| `Filter.CheckBox` | `Boolean` | A checkbox control, similar to HTML's `<input type="checkbox">`. The state is `true` if it's checked. |
| `Filter.TriState` | `Int` | A enhanced checkbox control that supports an excluding state. The state can be compared with `STATE_IGNORE`, `STATE_INCLUDE` and `STATE_EXCLUDE` constants of the class. |
| `Filter.Group<V>` | `List<V>` | A group of filters (preferentially of the same type). The state will be a `List` with all the states. |
| `Filter.Sort` | `Selection` | A control for sorting, with support for the ordering. The state indicates which item index is selected and if the sorting is `ascending`. |

All control filters can have a default state set. It's usually recommended if the source have filters to make the initial state match the popular manga list, so when the user open the filter sheet, the state is equal and represents the current manga showing.

The `Filter` classes can also be extended, so you can create new custom filters like the `UriPartFilter`:

```kotlin
open class UriPartFilter(displayName: String, private val vals: Array<Pair<String, String>>) :
    Filter.Select<String>(displayName, vals.map { it.first }.toTypedArray()) {
    fun toUriPart() = vals[state].second
}
```

#### Anime Details

- When user taps on an anime, `fetchAnimeDetails` and `fetchEpisodeList` will be called and the results will be cached.
    - A `SAnime` entry is identified by its `url`.
- `fetchAnimeDetails` is called to update an anime's details from when it was initialized earlier.
    - `SAnime.initialized` tells the app if it should call `fetchAnimeDetails`. If you are overriding `fetchAnimeDetails`, make sure to pass it as `true`.
    - `SAnime.genre` is a string containing list of all genres separated with `", "`.
    - `SAnime.status` is an "enum" value. Refer to [the values in the `SAnime` companion object](https://github.com/jmir1/extensions-lib/blob/a61fa402d3dcbb1402ce0cf252259cdc1b489b7e/library/src/main/java/eu/kanade/tachiyomi/animesource/model/SAnime.kt#L24-L27).
    - During a backup, only `url` and `title` are stored. To restore the rest of the anime data, the app calls `fetchAnimeDetails`, so all fields should be (re)filled in if possible.
    - If a `SAnime` is cached `fetchAnimeDetails` will be only called when the user does a manual update(Swipe-to-Refresh).
- `fetchEpisodeList` is called to display the episode list.
    - The list should be sorted descending by the source order.
    - If `Video.videoUrl`s are available immediately, you should pass them here. Otherwise, you should set `video.url` to a page that contains them and override `videoUrlParse` to fill those `videoUrl`s.

#### Episode

- After an episode list for the anime is fetched and the app is going to cache the data, `prepareNewEpisode` will be called.
- `SEpisode.date_upload` is the [UNIX Epoch time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) **expressed in milliseconds**.
    - If you don't pass `SEpisode.date_upload` and leave it zero, the app will use the default date instead, but it's recommended to always fill it if it's available.
    - To get the time in milliseconds from a date string, you can use a `SimpleDateFormat` like in the example below.

      ```kotlin
      private fun parseDate(dateStr: String): Long {
          return runCatching { DATE_FORMATTER.parse(dateStr)?.time }
              .getOrNull() ?: 0L
      }
      companion object {
          private val DATE_FORMATTER by lazy {
              SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss", Locale.ENGLISH)
          }
      }
      ```

      Make sure you make the `SimpleDateFormat` a class constant or variable so it doesn't get recreated for every episode. If you need to parse or format dates in anime description, create another instance since `SimpleDateFormat` is not thread-safe.
    - If the parsing have any problem, make sure to return `0L` so the app will use the default date instead.
    - The app will overwrite dates of existing old episodes **UNLESS** `0L` is returned.
    - The default date has [changed](https://github.com/jmir1/aniyomi/pull/7197) in Aniyomi preview ≥ r4442 or stable > 0.13.4.
        - In older versions, the default date is always the fetch date.
        - In newer versions, this is the same if every (new) episode has `0L` returned.
        - However, if the source only provides the upload date of the latest episode, you can now set it to the latest episode and leave other episodes default. The app will automatically set it (instead of fetch date) to every new episode and leave old episodes' dates untouched.

#### Episode Videos

- When user opens an episode, `fetchVideoList` will be called and it will return a list of `Video`s that are used by the player.

### Misc notes

- Sometimes you may find no use for some inherited methods. If so just override them and throw exceptions: `throw UnsupportedOperationException("Not used.")`
- You probably will find `getUrlWithoutDomain` useful when parsing the target source URLs.
- If possible try to stick to the general workflow from `AnimeHttpSource`/`ParsedAnimeHttpSource`; breaking them may cause you more headache than necessary.
- By implementing `ConfigurableAnimeSource` you can add settings to your source, which is backed by [`SharedPreferences`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/SharedPreferences).

### Advanced Extension features

#### URL intent filter

Extensions can define URL intent filters by defining it inside a custom `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
For an example, refer to [the NHentai module's `AndroidManifest.xml` file](https://github.com/jmir1/aniyomi-extensions/blob/master/src/all/nhentai/AndroidManifest.xml) and [its corresponding `NHUrlActivity` handler](https://github.com/jmir1/aniyomi-extensions/blob/master/src/all/nhentai/src/eu/kanade/tachiyomi/extension/all/nhentai/NHUrlActivity.kt).

To test if the URL intent filter is working as expected, you can try opening the website in a browser and navigating to the endpoint that was added as a filter or clicking a hyperlink. Alternatively, you can use the `adb` command below.

```console
$ adb shell am start -d "<your-link>" -a android.intent.action.VIEW
```

#### Renaming existing sources

There is some cases where existing sources changes their name on the website. To correctly reflect these changes in the extension, you need to explicity set the `id` to the same old value, otherwise it will get changed by the new `name` value and users will be forced to migrate back to the source.

To get the current `id` value before the name change, you can search the source name in the [repository JSON file](https://github.com/jmir1/aniyomi-extensions/blob/repo/index.json) by looking into the `sources` attribute of the extension. When you have the `id` copied, you can override it in the source:

```kotlin
override val id: Long = <the-id>
```

Then the class name and the `name` attribute value can be changed. Also don't forget to update the extension name and class name in the individual Gradle file if it is not a multisrc extension.

**Important:** the package name **needs** to be the same (even if it has the old name), otherwise users will not receive the extension update when it gets published in the repository. If you're changing the name of a multisrc source, you can manually set it in the generator class of the theme by using `pkgName = "oldpackagename"`.

The `id` also needs to be explicity set to the old value if you're changing the `lang` attribute.

## Multi-source themes
The `multisrc` module houses source code for generating extensions for cases where multiple source sites use the same site generator tool(usually a CMS) for bootstraping their website and this makes them similar enough to prompt code reuse through inheritance/composition; which from now on we will use the general **theme** term to refer to.

This module contains the *default implementation* for each theme and definitions for each source that builds upon that default implementation and also it's overrides upon that default implementation, all of this becomes a set of source code which then is used to generate individual extensions from.

```

- `multisrc/src/main/java/eu/kanade/tachiyomi/multisrc/<themepkg>/<Theme>.kt` defines the the theme's default implementation.
- `multisrc/src/main/java/eu/kanade/tachiyomi/multisrc/<theme>/<Theme>Generator.kt` defines the the theme's generator class, this is similar to a `AnimeSourceFactory` class.
- `multisrc/overrides/<themepkg>/default/res` is the theme's default icons, if a source doesn't have overrides for `res`, then default icons will be used.
- `multisrc/overrides/<themepkg>/default/additional.gradle.kts` defines additional gradle code, this will be copied at the end of all generated sources from this theme.
- `multisrc/overrides/<themepkg>/<sourcepkg>` contains overrides for a source that is defined inside the `<Theme>Generator.kt` class.
- `multisrc/overrides/<themepkg>/<sourcepkg>/src` contains source overrides.
- `multisrc/overrides/<themepkg>/<sourcepkg>/res` contains override for icons.
- `multisrc/overrides/<themepkg>/<sourcepkg>/additional.gradle` defines additional gradle code, this will be copied at the end of the generated gradle file below the theme's `additional.gradle`.
- `multisrc/overrides/<themepkg>/<sourcepkg>/AndroidManifest.xml` is copied as an override to the default `AndroidManifest.xml` generation if it exists.

### Development workflow
There are three steps in running and testing a theme source:

1. Generate the sources
    - **Option 1: Only generate sources from one theme**
        - **Method 1:** Find and run `<ThemeName>Generator` run configuration form the `Run/Debug Configuration` menu.
        - **Method 2:** Directly run `<themepkg>.<ThemeName>Generator.main` by pressing the play button in front of the method shown inside Android Studio's Code Editor to generate sources from the said theme.
    - **Option 2: Generate sources from all themes**
        - **Method 1:** Run `./gradlew multisrc:generateExtensions` from a terminal window to generate all sources.
        - **Method 2:** Directly run `Generator.GeneratorMain.main` by pressing the play button in front of the method shown inside Android Studio's Code Editor to generate all sources.
2. Sync gradle to import the new generated sources inside `generated-src`
    - **Method 1:** Android Studio might prompt to sync the gradle. Click on `Sync Now`.
    - **Method 2:** Manually re-sync by opening `File` -> `Sync Project with Gradle Files` or by pressing `Alt+f` then `g`.
3. Build and test the generated Extention like normal `src` sources.
    - It's recommended to make changes here to skip going through step 1 and 2 multiple times, and when you are done, copying the changes back to `multisrc`.

### Scaffolding overrides
You can use this python script to generate scaffolds for source overrides. Put it inside `multisrc/overrides/<themepkg>/` as `scaffold.py`.
```python
import os, sys
from pathlib import Path

theme = Path(os.getcwd()).parts[-1]

print(f"Detected theme: {theme}")

if len(sys.argv) < 3:
    print("Must be called with a class name and lang, for Example 'python scaffold.py LeviatanScans en'")
    exit(-1)

source = sys.argv[1]
package = source.lower()
lang = sys.argv[2]

print(f"working on {source} with lang {lang}")

os.makedirs(f"{package}/src")
os.makedirs(f"{package}/res")

with open(f"{package}/src/{source}.kt", "w") as f:
    f.write(f"package eu.kanade.tachiyomi.animeextension.{lang}.{package}\n\n")
```

### Additional Notes
- Generated sources extension version code is calculated as `baseVersionCode + overrideVersionCode + multisrcLibraryVersion`.
    - Currently `multisrcLibraryVersion` is `0`
    - When a new source is added, it doesn't need to set `overrideVersionCode` as it's default is `0`.
    - For each time a source changes in a way that should the version increase, `overrideVersionCode` should be increased by one.
    - When a theme's default implementation changes, `baseVersionCode` should be increased, the initial value should be `1`.
    - For example, for a new theme with a new source, extention version code will be `0 + 0 + 1 = 1`.
- `IntelijConfigurationGeneratorMainKt` should be run on creating or removing a multisrc theme.
    - On removing a theme, you can manually remove the corresponding configuration in the `.run` folder instead.
    - Be careful if you're using sparse checkout. If other configurations are accidentally removed, `git add` the file you want and `git restore` the others. Another choice is to allow `/multisrc/src/main/java/eu/kanade/tachiyomi/multisrc/*` before running the generator.

## Running

To make local development more convenient, you can use the following run configuration to launch Aniyomi directly at the Browse panel:

![](https://i.imgur.com/STy0UFY.png)

If you're running a Preview or debug build of Aniyomi:

```
-W -S -n xyz.jmir.tachiyomi.mi.debug/eu.kanade.tachiyomi.ui.main.MainActivity -a eu.kanade.tachiyomi.SHOW_CATALOGUES
```

And for a release build of Aniyomi:

```
-W -S -n xyz.jmir.tachiyomi.mi/eu.kanade.tachiyomi.ui.main.MainActivity -a eu.kanade.tachiyomi.SHOW_CATALOGUES
```

If you're deploying to Android 11 or higher, enable the "Always install with package manager" option in the run configurations.

## Debugging

### Android Debugger

You can leverage the Android Debugger to step through your extension while debugging.

You *cannot* simply use Android Studio's `Debug 'module.name'` -> this will most likely result in an error while launching.

Instead, once you've built and installed your extension on the target device, use `Attach Debugger to Android Process` to start debugging Aniyomi.

### Logs

You can also elect to simply rely on logs printed from your extension, which
show up in the [`Logcat`](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/am-logcat) panel of Android Studio.

### Inspecting network calls
One of the easiest way to inspect network issues (such as HTTP errors 404, 429, no chapter found etc.) is to use the [`Logcat`](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/am-logcat) panel of Android Studio and filtering by the `OkHttpClient` tag.

To be able to check the calls done by OkHttp, you need to enable verbose logging in the app, that is not enabled by default and is only included in the Preview versions of Aniyomi. To enable it, go to More -> Settings -> Advanced -> Verbose logging. After enabling it, don't forget to restart the app.

Inspecting the Logcat allows you to get a good look at the call flow and it's more than enough in most cases where issues occurs. However, alternatively, you can also use an external tool like `mitm-proxy`. For that, refer to the next section.

### Using external network inspecting tools
If you want to take a deeper look into the network flow, such as taking a look into the request and response bodies, you can use an external tool like `mitm-proxy`.

#### Setup your proxy server
We are going to use [mitm-proxy](https://mitmproxy.org/) but you can replace it with any other Web Debugger (i.e. Charles, burp, Fiddler etc). To install and execute, follow the commands bellow.

```console
Install the tool.
$ sudo pip3 install mitmproxy
Execute the web interface and the proxy.
$ mitmweb
```

Alternatively, you can also use the Docker image:

```
$ docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 \
    -p 127.0.0.1:8081:8081 \
    --web-host 0.0.0.0 \
    mitmproxy/mitmproxy mitmweb
```

After installing and running, open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8081.

#### OkHttp proxy setup
Since most of the manga sources are going to use HTTPS, we need to disable SSL verification in order to use the web debugger. For that, add this code to inside your source class:


```kotlin
class AnimeSource : MadTheme(
    "AnimeSource",
    "https://example.com",
    "en"
) {
    private fun OkHttpClient.Builder.ignoreAllSSLErrors(): OkHttpClient.Builder {
        val naiveTrustManager = object : X509TrustManager {
            override fun getAcceptedIssuers(): Array<X509Certificate> = arrayOf()
            override fun checkClientTrusted(certs: Array<X509Certificate>, authType: String) = Unit
            override fun checkServerTrusted(certs: Array<X509Certificate>, authType: String) = Unit
        }

        val insecureSocketFactory = SSLContext.getInstance("TLSv1.2").apply {
            val trustAllCerts = arrayOf<TrustManager>(naiveTrustManager)
            init(null, trustAllCerts, SecureRandom())
        }.socketFactory

        sslSocketFactory(insecureSocketFactory, naiveTrustManager)
        hostnameVerifier(HostnameVerifier { _, _ -> true })
        return this
    }

    override val client: OkHttpClient = network.cloudflareClient.newBuilder()
        .ignoreAllSSLErrors()
        .proxy(Proxy(Proxy.Type.HTTP, InetSocketAddress("10.0.2.2", 8080)))
        ....
        .build()
```

Note: `10.0.2.2` is usually the address of your loopback interface in the android emulator. If Aniyomi tells you that it's unable to connect to 10.0.2.2:8080 you will likely need to change it (the same if you are using hardware device).

If all went well, you should see all requests and responses made by the source in the web interface of `mitmweb`.

## Building

APKs can be created in Android Studio via `Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)` or `Build > Generate Signed Bundle / APK`.

## Submitting the changes

When you feel confident about your changes, submit a new Pull Request so your code can be reviewed and merged if it's approved. We encourage following a [GitHub Standard Fork & Pull Request Workflow](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962) and following the good practices of the workflow, such as not commiting directly to `master`: always create a new branch for your changes.

If you are more comfortable about using Git GUI-based tools, you can refer to [this guide](https://learntodroid.com/how-to-use-git-and-github-in-android-studio/) about the Git integration inside Android Studio, specifically the "How to Contribute to an to Existing Git Repository in Android Studio" section of the guide.

Please **do test your changes by compiling it through Android Studio** before submitting it. Also make sure to follow the PR checklist available in the PR body field when creating a new PR. As a reference, you can find it below.

### Pull Request checklist

- Update `extVersionCode` value in `build.gradle` for individual extensions
- Update `overrideVersionCode` or `baseVersionCode` as needed for all multisrc extensions
- Reference all related issues in the PR body (e.g. "Closes #xyz")
- Add the `containsNsfw = true` flag in `build.gradle` when appropriate
- Explicitly kept the `id` if a source's name or language were changed
- Test the modifications by compiling and running the extension through Android Studio
